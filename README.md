# Bear Simplenote Import

bear_simplenote_import.py   
*Version 1.0.0 - 2018-02-11 at 20:38 EST*


* Text import to Bear from Simlenote's local xml database  
(Should work with simplenote.app Version 1.2 (1200) from Mac appstore installed.
* Open simplenote.app and let it finish any pending sync before running this script.)
* As file export: `simplenote_id_#.txt`, with tags, creation, and modified dates from Simplenote :)  
* Then manual file import in Bear with option:  
`Keep original creation and modification date` checked.   
Leave all the other options UNCHECKED!
* Or chose direct import into Bear, with tags, but no dates.

**NOTE!** Make sure nvALT is not active!

**NOTE!** Script does not delete old exports, so if running this several times, you should delete old export manually before running it second time!
